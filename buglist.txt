Report: In my inventory function, hitting 'v' is reported to crash the
machine.  Appears to be a DOS symptom, but I bet it's caused by a memory
allocation mistake on my part.  Can't reproduce, can't find problem.
Solution: appears to be a bad download.  Symptom didn't recur when user
re-downloaded.

Report: Colors not correct on Macs.
Solution: major work.  In progress.

Report: Bright backgrounds blinking on PCs.
Solution:  Oops.  Easy fix -- next version.
