You are a novice adventurer, who has recently set off in search of
fame, fortune, glory, and a good time. In your travels, you have come
upon the ruined city of some mysterious elder civilization. In the
center of the city is a large bluestone sculpture shaped like:

                              ****
                            **    **
                           *        *
                           *        *
                            *      *
                             *    *
                          ****    ****

Touching the figure was a bad move; an eerie violet glow arose, and
you blacked out. Waking up, you found yourself in the city of Rampart
on a world called LOCUS. You have a paltry few gold pieces in your
pockets, and you realize survival will be a priority....








			      omega

...is a complex rogue-style game of dungeon exploration.  Unlike other
such games, there are a number of ways to win, depending on various
actions taken during play. The ways you can get your name on the
hiscore board include becoming the highest ranked head of a guild,
sect, college, etc., as well as gaining the most points figured from
possessions and experience.  Hint: There is a way to become a "total
winner", various paths can lead to this ultimate goal.

omega offers a richness of playing detail that goes beyond a simple
game like rogue. However, the majority of gameplay is very similar to
rogue, hack, ultrarogue, larn, and other such games. The player is
represented by the "@" symbol, objects and terrain features are
represented by non-alphabetic symbols, and monsters and non-player
characters (NPC's) are represented by the various upper and lower case
letters. It is recommended that the novice read the man pages for
rogue or some other such game and perhaps play a few games before
playing omega. The remainder of this document assumes a basic
familiarity with rogue-style games.


OMEGA STRUCTURE
===============

Omega currently consists of a city level (Rampart) above a number of
dungeon levels. There are several entrances to the dungeons concealed
about the city. Obviously they are not just sitting around open on the
street (In this respect, Rampart is quite unlike New York City). A thorough
search of the city will find the entrances, which remain fixed from game
to game. In addition, various hints will also lead to these entrances.
Although the dungeon levels may be constructed according to one of four
protocols, each has at least four staircases, two going up, two going
down. Some staircases go up or down more than one level, so be
careful about going too deep before you are ready....

Future versions of omega will have multiple dungeons and cities
scattered about a countryside.

CHARACTER CREATION AND DEVELOPMENT
==================================
You will have the opportunity to create a new character each time you
start up omega. You can apportion points among Strength, Constitution,
Dexterity, Agility, Intelligence, and Power. Each of these is very
important, but depending what sort of character you wish to play,
different statistics will stand out. Combat is helped by Strength and
Dexterity, Magic-use is aided by Intelligence and Power. Agility
helps you avoid getting hit and avoid traps, while Constitution
determines how many hits you can take before dying.

Each time you create a character, you will have the opportunity to
save the set up in a file .omegarc which will make it easier to start
the game in the future. omega will check for a .omegarc in your wd.
You need not use your .omegarc if it is there. The .omegarc stores
starting statistics, starting options settings, name, and sexual
preference. You can rename your character with the 'R' command, so if
that is the only change you tend to make you need not always be saving
new .omegarc's.

As you continue to play, you will hopefully accumulate experience and
treasure. You can gain skills and abilities through various means,
the most important being training in one of the Rampart establishments
devoted to self-improvement. Thus, you can choose to work out at the
gym, study at the Collegium Magii, meditate at a Temple, and
so on. Certain skills and abilities may only be gained through
adventuring, and others are mutually exclusive. For example, you can
only be a servant of one particular deity. One of the appeals of
omega is the variety of different types of characters you can play,
each with its own set of goals and benefits.

Another aspect of your character is alignment. Characters are aligned
towards the primal forces of Chaos and Law, or they can be neutral.
Various actions affect this factor; killing peaceful monsters, or
committing burgalry, for example, are chaotic acts.  Alignment
determines which guilds will let you in, the behavior of some
artifacts and monsters, as well as much else.

Your character will gain various statuses, abilities, immunities,
etc., both harmful and beneficial. Most of the time these are kept
hidden from you, but there are various ways of discovering the truth
-- self-knowledge is very useful in omega.

EXPERIENCE 
========== 
Experience is accrued for skillful actions in the game. As in rogue,
one of the main methods of acquiring experience is defeating monsters.
You need not kill an opponent to defeat it (see the T command).  There
are many other ways of gaining experience, though, including learning
spells, deactivating traps, using artifacts correctly, etc.  As
experience is gained, the character will increase in hit points,
combat ability, and spellcasting potential, and will eventually be
able to increase his rank in the various guilds. Gaining an
experience level increases maximum hit points but not current
hit points so you cannot suddenly save yourself in a large battle
by going up in rank. 

GAMEPLAY
======== 
The mechanics are much like rogue, hack, etc. A variety of options are
available to customize the interface. The command list is always
useful to have around, but is also accessible from the '?' command.

There are a number of windows used in the game. The main (central)
window shows the current map of the dungeon, city or wilderness. A
single level is typically one screen in width and four in length, for
a 64 x 64 level. The top line is a message window describing what is
now going on. The bottom two lines form a window showing various
player statistics. The right-hand column is a status window showing
current conditions, and another line below the map describes the
current environment. A menu window will sometimes overlap the rest of
the screen for various reasons.

COMBAT
======
The player has two defensive statistics, "Defense" and "Protection".
Defense determines how hard it is to hit the player and is determined
mostly by a combination of agility and level.  Protection is the
protection from damage offered by armor. The higher the statistic, the
better.  Note that most forms of armor raise Protection at the cost of
Defense.  Shields raise Defense without affecting Protection. There
are also various forms of magic and magic items that affect these
statistics, which are visible in the mode line.

The Player also has two offensive statistics, "Accuracy" and "Damage".
Accuracy is determined by the Player's dexterity, level, and the
weapon used. Damage is the amount of damage done on a successful hit to
an opponent and is determined by the Player's strength and the weapon
used.

omega has two combat modes. In some circumstances it may be more advantageous
to use one over the other; in others you will have no choice.

Regular Combat Mode:

RCM is just like in rogue, hack, et al. A move that would place you on
a monster is construed as an attack. omega additionally offers
Tactical Combat Mode, which can be used via the 'F' command, or is
used automatically in some special situations, like in the Arena.

Tactical Combat Mode:

TCM allows you to select precisely which actions you will choose in a
given combat round -- parry high, thrust low, etc.  You have several
maneuver points for use in each TCM round, depending on level, status
as a gladiator, etc.

ATTACK: Cut, Strike, Shoot, or Thrust (depending on weapon)     -- 1 pt.
BLOCK: Prepare to block enemy attack                            -- 1 pt.
RIPOSTE: BLOCK/ATTACK (thrusting weapons only)                  -- 2 pts.
LUNGE: More chance to hit than usual, does more damage          -- 2 pts.
GET: Pick up an item on the ground                              -- All pts.
WIELD: Use an item (weapon, typically) already owned            -- All pts.
MAGIC: Cast a spell                                             -- All pts.
DISENGAGE: Try to get out of Tactical Mode (helped by AGILITY)  -- All pts.

You can try multiple identical maneuvers if you like. If you don't try
any BLOCKS, it will be easier than usual for your opponent to hit.
Even if you don't get the location correct, a BLOCK still does some
good. A riposte attacks in the same line as its block, if you got the
line right. I.e., if you are attacked high, a high riposte will get a
free attack back. If you are attacked high three times, a high riposte
will get three free attacks back.

It should be noted that it is disadvantageous to block in the same line
as an attack, as your block tends to get in the way of the attack. You
may wish to do something like blocking in two lines and attacking in
the other, or vice versa.

Heavy edged weapons and smashing weapons do CUTTING or STRIKING
damage. Your strength affects this, so if it is high you will do
much more damage, and if low, much less.

Light edged weapons, missile weapons, and pointed weapons do THRUSTING
or SHOOTING attacks, whose chance to hit is greatly affected by your
dexterity.

Naturally, TCM takes much longer to work out, but it may prove
helpful, particularly when one monster's characteristic form of attack
or defense is learned. All monsters are happy to oblige you with
combat in either mode. Later versions will hopefully show more
intelligence in this mode. At present, some monsters are easier
to deal with in RCM, and some in TCM.


MAGIC 
===== 
Your character may be taught spells by his or her guilds, at the
collegium magii, or pick them up from a scroll of spells. Every spell
costs some amount of mana to cast. Mana is not normally regenerated
except when the player goes up an experience level, but various magic
items augment mana, and the sorceror's guild also will recharge you
for a fee. If you learn the same spell multiple times, the effective
power drain to cast the spell is lowered.


GETTING INFORMATION
===================
To be successful at omega, you must uncover secrets and solve
mysteries.  You can get information in a number of ways (reading the
source code is strictly discouraged :-), but one of the most important
ways is "talking" to monsters and NPC's.  Even if you don't get any
useful info, you may still find out something about the creature
you're talking to. In particular human beings are usually on the
screen as "m" or "w" (depending on sex), and you maybe able to
figure out just who you are dealing with by talking to them. The
usual course of action is to "greet" strangers. Threatening them
is often counterproductive, but may induce weaker or injured
opponents to give up. Threatening is a lawful action if you would
otherwise wind up killing your opponent. On the other hand you
may be able to "yield" to stronger opponents who, if they are
merciful, will let you go after relieving you of some treasure.
Warning: Monsters who defeat you will grow stronger as they too
gain experience....


RANDOM DETAILS
==============
Starting the Game:

You will first want to explore the city of Rampart. Although the
architecture and important sites remain the same from game to game,
details such as the precise position of certain shops, etc. will
change. Rampart is relatively safe if you don't wander into places
that are obviously dangerous or do things like breaking and entering.
If you are reckless, it is quite possible to get killed before ever
finding the dungeon. The dungeon entrance(s) are concealed around
Rampart. You wouldn't expect them to be out in the open, now,
would you?

Many Rampart establishments are only open in the daytime, but some
are only active at night. Due to the stringent anti-crime measures
taken by the Duke, it is usually safe to sleep in the streets. You
will find it far more rewarding, however, to rent or purchase your
own lodgings, if you can afford them.


Dungeon Map Example:

##########    
#........#    This bit of a screen represents a room. The walls are "#",
#..@...g.-    the floor is ".", there is a staircase in the lower lefthand
#....)...#    corner, and a closed door in the right wall. A goblin is menacing
#>......~#    the player, and a weapon lies on the floor not far away. There
##########    is a pool in the lower righthand corner.

Since the same character can represent different things or entities, a
good command to remember is 'x' (examine), which will tell you
precisely what you are dealing with in any situation. This is
especially helpful before you have terrain types like deep pools and
lava pits (!) memorized.... You can use the CONFIRM option to avoid
walking absent-mindedly into a trap, pool, etc.  The '/' command will
give you more general help, for example telling you that the ')'
character represents a weapon. The '?' command can give you either a
command list or this file.


Saving and Restoring: 

Since omega's dungeon is quite large, only the current dungeon level
and the city level will be saved; others will be regenerated as you
re-enter them. You might simply consider that the "actual" levels are
far larger than is apparent, and you are just traversing a different
part on each restore.... If you know the spell of Return, however,
(learnable at the Explorers' Club) you will be able to warp to your
deepest excursion in the dungeons without having to retraverse the old
levels in between.

Games can be restored by giving the save file as a command line argument
as in:

% omega quasar.sav

The implementor will decide whether to enable filechecking routines
to ensure that characters are not copied. It's in poor taste, though,
to clone a character....


Option Settings:

Options may be set with the 'O' command. The options are:

(F) BELLICOSE: Automatically attack things you run into.
(F) JUMPMOVE: Don't display things until the end of a run.
(T) ASKME: Automatically pick things up when you move over them.
(T) RUNSTOP: Stop a run when something like a door is passed.
(T) CONFIRM: Ask confirmation before you do some dangerous things.
(1) SEARCHNUM: the number of turns spent searching when you hit the 's' key.

The default values are parenthesized. These options will be recovered from
your .omegarc if you use one.


Flags:

In the upper right corner of the omega display, below the date and
time, and phase of the moon, you will see three flags: The top
describes your food status, the middle describes your status with
respect to poison, and the bottom your health (diseased or healthy).
While you are diseased you will not regain hit points naturally. While
you are poisoned you will take damage each round until cured or killed
(or the poison's effect can naturally fade).  When your food runs out,
and you start starving, you will take more and more damage as time
passes until finally you die of starvation.  It's always a good idea
to stock up at the Commandant's....


Combat Abilities:

In the lower right of the display, your current combat abilities
are displayed.

Hit: is your current chance to hit with the weapon currently wielded,
     the higher the better. This factor varies with your dexterity,
     experience level, and the weapon wielded.
Dmg: is the maximum amount of damage you can do with a hit. This factor
     varies with your strength and the weapon wielded.
Def: is your defensive rating, how hard it is for monsters to hit you. This
     factor varies with your agility and experience level.
Arm: is your armor rating, how much damage is absorbed when a monster
     hits you before you take damage. Armor only absorbs normal damage;
     various effects and forms of magic may penetrate armor. This factor
     varies with the armor worn.
Spd: is a speed factor, how quickly or how slowly you move. This factor is
     calculated about a base of 1.00; 2.00 means you move twice as fast;
     0.50 means you move twice as slowly. This factor varies with your
     agility and the amount of weight you are carrying.

Magic spells, special items, and monster effects can affect all these factors,
positively and negatively.
