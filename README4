OMEGA MAINTENANCE
=================

There should be little need for the wizard to actively maintain the
game. But.....

After years of play, the file omega.log may get unwieldy and overlarge.
This file can simply be truncated as follows. Log records are now
one line at a time, so just delete as many lines as you like, making
sure there are no blank lines, and that the file ends on an end of
line.

You can even remove omega.log completely as long as you replace it
with a null file of the same name. omega.log must be publically
writeable.

The file omega.hi is a high score list. This file can't be truncated
or removed, but you can edit it as you feel to be appropriate. If you
look in ofile.c you can figure out what those numbers in the
file actually mean; usually one is NPC level and one is NPC behavior,
but some entries have another entry such as alignment. The
distribution comes with a "safety" version of the original high
score file; if anything happens to the original you can just
copy omegahi.bak to omega.hi, making sure of course it has
public write access.

Anyone can mung the log and hiscore files simply by writing to them
(unless you used setuid, anyhow). In my opinion, people who hack
score files can very easily be taken care of by deleting
their accounts; if that doesn't work, shoot them.

WIZARD MODE
===========

If you are the WIZARD as defined in odefs.h, you can enter wizard mode
by hitting ^g. If you ever set wizard mode, your high scores and npc
will not be saved.

In wizard mode, ^x gives you a wish. ^w draws the current level, ^k
allows you to set an arbitrary game status bit, meanings of the bits
are given in odefs.h. The possible wishes are listed in oscroll3.txt,
and the code for them is in oeffect1.c
