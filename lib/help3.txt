INVENTORY
=========
Unlike rogue, et al., you cannot directly employ every object you carry. Every
object may either go into your "pack" or into some specific inventory slot such
as "belt" or "ready hand" or "left shoulder" etc. Some slots are dedicated to
certain types of items (eg, only armor can go in the armor slot), but other
slots are general purpose, like your belt or your shoulder.

When you pick up an item, it gets stored in your pack. To equip an from your
pack, press 'i' and then select the letter corresponding to the slot you wish
to equip it to. It takes game time to equip an object from your pack. The deeper
you burrow into your pack for an item, the more game time you are wasting.
Therefore, carrying a whole lot of (semi)useless items may be a strategically
bad move. Of course, as always, you can't carry more weight (either in your pack
or in your inventory slots) than is dictated by your current STRENGTH and
AGILITY.

You can drop an item from your pack with 'd'. You cannot drop an equipped item
without first transferring it back to your pack. Items dropped on the world map
are lost forever.
