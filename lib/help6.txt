BUGS AND FEATURES
=================
"It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature." 

Omega is not just a large program, it is a large, complicated, and not
particularly well written program. There are so many features that not all can
be well tested, particularly in combination with one another. Therefore, it is
likely that your version, whatever it is, has some bugs. You can report a bug or
request a new feature on GitHub: https://github.com/Lyle-Tafoya/Omega/issues
