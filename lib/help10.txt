SAVING AND RESTORING
==================== 
Since Omega's dungeon is quite large, only the current dungeon and the city
level will be saved; other dungeons you may have entered previously will be
regenerated as you re-enter them. If you know the spell of Return, however,
(learnable at the Explorers' Club) you will be able to warp to your deepest
excursion in any dungeon without having to retraverse the old levels in between.
Some other shortcuts exist for "warping" from one locale or level to another.

Your game can be saved with the 'S' command. Saved games can be loaded from
main menu.

To at least simulate the continuity of character in the game, save game files
will be deleted on restoration. Of course, you *can* copy them.
