This project has been relicensed to GPLv3 effective Augst 24th, 2023.

Permission for this change was received from:
  Laurence Raphael Brothers - August 21st, 2023 - email
  Nathan Glasser            - August 24th, 2023 - LinkedIn message
  Erik Max Francis          - August 24th, 2023 - email
  Robert Rendell            - August 24th, 2023 - email

ATTENTION:
At the time this project was relicensed to GPLv3, it was my belief that
permission was only needed from Laurence Brothers due to a clause in his
original license which stated: 'Any modifications are considered
"works for hire" and ownership of omega will be retained by me'. However, some
people have expressed some doubt as to whether this clause in the original
license is legally binding. If it is legally binding, then no further permission
should be necessary. However, if it is not, then every code contributor needs to
give their permission before this can be relicensed as GPLv3. I am trying to
obtain permission from all known contributors, just to be absolutely certain
that the relicense to GPLv3 is valid. Until then, it should be assumed that the
original licence (in the file "license.original") is still in effect unless a
legal expert advises otherwise.

A list of known contributors who I have not yet received permission from:
  William Tanksley
  Sheldon Simms

Special thanks to Josh Backstein (https://github.com/joshbackstein) for helping
