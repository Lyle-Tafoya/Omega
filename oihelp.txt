INVENTORY CONTROL MODES
=======================

There are two type of inventory control: Display mode and Quick mode.
Which mode you use by default can be toggled by the TOPLINE option
settable with the 'O' command and in your .omegarc file.

In Display mode, all the inventory slots are displayed in the menu
window. In Quick mode, only the message lines above the main window
are used, and therefore the slots are not all displayed, only
one of them at a time. Additionally, the commands are slightly 
different. The amount of time each action takes is indicated
below. Dropping two items takes twice as long as dropping
one item.

Note that your pack is treated as a LIFO stack; the last object you
put in is the easiest to get at.

DISPLAY MODE:
^l,^r: Redisplay inventory (if screen is munged). Takes no time.
d:  Drop the item currently in the 'up-in-the-air' slot, or in the
    'selected' slot if there is nothing 'up-in-the-air'.
    Takes one second.
p:  Put the 'up-in-the-air' item into your pack, or the 'selected'
    item, if the 'up-in-the-air' item is vacant.
    Takes 5 seconds.
s:  Show the contents of your pack.
    Takes 5 seconds.
t:  Take an item from your pack and put into the 'selected' slot, or
    if that is full, tries to put into the 'up-in-the-air' slot.
    Takes 5 seconds + 1 second/item examined in pack. I.e., rummaging
    at three items before taking one takes 8 seconds.
x:  Exchange the 'up-in-the-air' slot with the 'selected' slot. This
    will merge two quantities of an item together if possible.
    Either the 'up-in-the-air' slot or the 'selected' slot can be vacant.
    Takes 2 seconds.
>:  Cause the next slot lower down to be the 'selected' one.
    Takes no time.
<:  Cause the next slot higher up to be the 'selected' one.
    Takes no time.
?:  Print this help.
    Takes no time.
ESCAPE: return to game, dropping any object in the 'up-in-the-air' slot.
        Takes no time.

In Display Mode, the 'selected' slot is the one with a highlighted
'->' before it.

QUICK MODE:
d:  Drop an item (by default the one 'up-in-the-air').
    Takes one second.
e:  Examine some inventory slot.
    Takes no time.
p:  Put some item into your pack.
    Takes 5 seconds.
s:  Show the contents of your pack.
    Takes 5 seconds.
t:  Take an item from your pack and put into some inventory slot, or
    into the 'up-in-the-air' slot if the one selected is full.
    Takes 5 seconds + 1/item examined in pack.
x:  Exchange the 'up-in-the-air' slot with some slot. This
    will merge two quantities of an item together if possible.
    Either the 'up-in-the-air' slot or the other slot can be vacant.
    Takes 2 seconds.
~:  Enter Display Mode.
    Takes no time.
?:  Print this help.
    Takes no time.
ESCAPE: return to game, dropping any object in the 'up-in-the-air' slot.
        Takes no time.

In quick mode, there is no 'selected' slot, instead the letter
identifying the slot must be entered following the command.

The 'x' command in both modes is the one you'll use most; it combines
taking and putting from inventory slot to "up-in-air" where picked-up
items will be, and where you will drop items from on leaving the
inventory mode.
