(The project demo is due tomorrow, er, that is, today, at 0900. It's
now 0300. Printouts, pizza boxes, and szechuan kitchen trays litter
your desk, and the bitmap screen seems to warp in and out of focus....
The compiler seems to be taking *FOREVER*....)

(You do a routine check on your filesystem...)

% df
Filesystem            kbytes    used   avail capacity  Mounted on
/users                     0    6818       0   999%    /
/secur/omega            +inf    +inf    +inf     0%    /

(How odd. The /secur filesystem definitely shouldn't be mounted; it must
be space used by the omega team, a very hush-hush project you know
nothing about. Well, no wonder the compiler is wedged; you don't seem
to have any disk space left. Unfortunately, there is no night
operator and you don't know the su password. Cursing, you figure you
can at least find out what the damn omega group is doing....)

% cd /secur/omega
% ls

% ls bin

% (Well, hell, what can happen? And if it does, it's not *MY* fault
the damn filesystem is mounted!)
% omega

(This was definitely a mistake. For long moments nothing seemed to happen.
Then there was a flare of bluish light from the workstation screen,
like a brightness of 256 on a scale of 0..7. You wake up with a
serious headache outside the massive gates of a walled city. You notice
a pouch at your side that seems to be filled with.... gold! You seem
to hear a faint voice fading off into the distance "Interrupt SIGZAP
at 0x0"....)
