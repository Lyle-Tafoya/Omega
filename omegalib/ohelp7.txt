MAGIC
=====
Your character may be taught spells by his or her guild or priesthood,
at the collegium magii, or pick them up from a scroll of spells. Every
spell costs some amount of mana to cast. Mana is not normally
regenerated except when the player goes up an experience level, but
various magic items augment mana, and the sorceror's guild will
recharge you for a fee. If you learn the same spell multiple times,
the effective power drain to cast the spell is lowered. Some spells
have a constant effect, while others vary according to your level.
The spell of ritual magic has a variety of different effects depending
on the circumstances under which it is cast. The spell of high magic
is the most powerful, by the way.
