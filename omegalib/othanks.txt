Thanks to:

Ben, Greg, Hammy, Izchak, Nathan, and Silver, for bug reports,
playtesting, suggestions, debugging, and general advice.

Thanks to the army of players and debuggers of versions 0.6
and 0.7; I predict a lot more work for you now....

More thanks to Nathan Glasser for the PC port, bugfixes, etc., without
whose enthusiasm there would be no version 0.75
