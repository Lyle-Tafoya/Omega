Bug reports and suggestions can also be sent to the current maintainer
of Omega.  Currently, this is
	omega@alcyone.darkside.com (Erik Max Francis)
Since Laurence has moved on and indicates that he is no longer interested
in maintaining the game, you have a much greater chance of action if you
email the maintainer.  Tom O. Breton (tob@world.std.com) is currently
working on tehomega, a complete re-write of omega - finger his account to
see how the project is progressing.

PC version comments can be sent to Nathan Glasser:

        nathan@brokaw.lcs.mit.edu
