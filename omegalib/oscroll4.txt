                    The Adepts' Manifesto.

``Mastery of the World can only be achieved by the Master of the Self.
For one who has total Self-Control, all things are possible.''

[Obvious hyperbole -- Librarian]

``The apex of High Magic is a triviality for a true Adept.''

[Surely, this is exaggeration -- Librarian]

``An Adept makes his own Destiny, and Destiny caters to the whims of
an Adept.''

[Oh, come now, be serious. -- Librarian]

``Only Self-Improvement can lead to Adepthood. Those who have not
raised their personal attributes to the highest values will
be inevitably destroyed in their quest for Adepthood.''

[Say what? -- Librarian]

``The Challenge of Adepthood is maintained by the Lords of Destiny.''

[Nonsense! -- Librarian]

``An Adept-Aspirant must be prepared to go beyond the trivial powers of
Magic, even spurning the tawdry attractions of Artifacts, if the
Aspirant would achieve Adepthood.''

[Me, I'll take the Artifacts... -- Librarian]

``The final test of an Adept is Mastery of that Void which lies both
within and without the Self.''

[Zen Gobbledygook. -- Librarian]

``Only an Adept can become a Total Winner.''

[What the heck is a Total Winner? -- Librarian]
