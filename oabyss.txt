After entering the abyss, your surroundings dissolved in a violent
blue flash. You seemed to float through creme-de-menthe colored
gelatin for an eternity. Gradually you seemed to be approaching some
surface in the distance.....

With a noise far louder than a popping soap-bubble, you find yourself
standing at one end of a narrow stone causeway. The floor is of
alternating squares of blue-veined orange and orange-veined blue
marble, for an effect rather like the Trump Tower atrium, except
worse. The causeway seems to hang suspended in the midst of a great
void. In the distance ahead the path seems to widen out into a large
platform. A chill runs down your spine and the floor is cold beneath
your bare feet. You notice that all your possessions seem to have been
lost somewhere.... All you have is your bare hands and brain....

There is the sound of a single bell chiming, and the musical tone
somehow reverberates for long moments despite the lack of walls to
provide echoes.

The note fades.

With a sudden roar, a blue flame erupts from the center of the
causeway! A strangely familiar voice rings out from it:

"Foolish Mortal! You have entered upon the Adept's Challenge...."

"There is no escape!"

"There is no victory!"

The flame flickers out. Well, you've really done it this time, haven't you?
