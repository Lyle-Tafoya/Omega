Select from the following maneuvers:

A  --  ATTACK. This takes one maneuver and executes an ordinary attack
       on whatever monster you attempt to move onto.

B  --  BLOCK. This takes one maneuver and means you are prepared to
       execute a defensive maneuver should any monster attack you.
       One BLOCK can defend against any number of attacks.

L  --  LUNGE. This take two maneuvers and executes an exceptional
       attack with extra chances to hit, and a bonus to damage. One
       LUNGE will probably not do as much damage as two ATTACKS,
       assuming of course that both ATTACKS hit....

R  --  RIPOSTE. This is the same as a block, except that should you
       successfully block an attack with it, you get a free attack
       back on the monster who attacked you. It takes two maneuvers
       and can only be done with a thrusting-type weapon.

Following the choice of the maneuver, you must select a line for the
action: L (low), C (center), or H (high). Some monster will tend to
attack in a given line (short/small monsters, for example, will
tend to attack low), so this choice is meaningful. If you block or
riposte low, when the attack is high, you will have wasted the effect
of the block. On the other hand, if you block low twice, and the
attack is low, you will defend doubly. If you don't block or riposte
at all, it will be particularly easy for monsters to hit you.

Keep on selecting maneuvers until you have no maneuver points left.
Hitting the BACKSPACE or DELETE key will erase your current choices
and let you start over. When you are satisfied, confirm your
choice with the RETURN key. Once a choice is selected, it stays in
effect until you change it; you need not reset it for each attack.
Selecting combat maneuvers takes no time.

If you are in VERBOSE mode (settable with the 'O' command) you'll see
just what the monster is doing, whether the blocks are effective,
and so on. Otherwise you'll just be told whether you hit or miss.
