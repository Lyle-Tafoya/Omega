BUGS AND FEATURES
=================
"It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature." 

omega is not just a large program, it is a large, complicated, and not
particularly well written program. There are so many features that not
all can be well tested, particularly in combination with one another.
Therefore, it is likely that your version, whatever it is, has some
bugs. The author always strives to correct bugs and remedy
misfeatures, so if you send mail to brothers@paul.rutgers.edu, he will
attempt to remedy the problem. Suggestions for further features,
monsters, traps, items, dungeons, etc. are also welcome.
