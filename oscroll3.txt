Being un Explication et Tretys on ye Powers of Hy Magick.

It ys whysper'd among the dark mages of Kulthar and also ye Gnomes of
Zrenheim that Hy Magick is unattainable. But I know the truth! Hy
Magick ys hard to come bye, tis true, but ye mightie and ye fortunat
may even discover ye secrets thereof with carful application of
their talents. It ys known that many have had the oppportunitie to
invoke ye Hy Magick but have failed du to ignorance, or fear.
For knoe ye this: If Hy Magick be not invoked with exactitude,
it will not manifest, so ye mages, ye prentices, ye thaumaturges,
ye seers: Hearken! And learn ye the proper words of invocation.
Make sure the word is spoken precislie as I put it herein.

'Death' is said by some to be a blessing, and it may be had from
ye offices of Hy Magick as I put it.

Many practicers of the Recondite Arts might wish for 'Power', but
this ys truelie not as great an office as one myte desyre, being
of strong but ephemeral effect.

'Skill', howbeit, ys a very fortunat benefice of Hy Magick.

Let not ye greed for material possessions best ye, for 'Wealth'
does not signifie so much as some other choyces.

The ones who walk the Way of the Druid may have occasion to request
'Balance' of ye Hy Magick, while other clarical seekers may
desire 'Law' or 'Chaos'.

Truelie, 'Knowledge' is a great thing to gayn of the Hy Magick.

Those poor ones who are afflicted myte well wish for 'Health'.

Travellers culd find theyr destinations with 'Location'.

Shuld a certain ytem of power be beyond thy grasp, 'Acquisition'
mought well gayn yt for thee.

Those seekers who learn from ye studie ye beast supernal could
wish for 'Summoning'.

Onlie True Adepts may wish for 'Destruction', it ys sayed.

It ys mine hope that this list may be of servis to other seekers after
Wysdom.
